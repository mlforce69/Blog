                <h2>The Future of the Computer Science.</h2>
                <p>
                  Many researchers are concerned about flat or declining
                  research budgets in computer science and engineering. Although
                  the research community is right to be concerned about the
                  shortage of funds, they should also be concerned about the
                  shortage of scientists and engineers that are willing to serve
                  in governments to address this challenge. Computer scientists
                  and engineers can have a huge impact on the future of the
                  field and the future of the U.S. By serving in the government,
                  they can design and launch new research initiatives, inform
                  IT-related policy decisions, and serve as a catalyst for
                  public-private partnerships involving government, industry,
                  and academia. In the U.S., one way of advancing computer
                  science and shaping public policy in computer science research
                  and education is by serving in federal agencies that oversee
                  investments in education and research in science and
                  technology. Program and division directors at the National
                  Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health
                  (NIH), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),
                  the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the
                  National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), the
                  United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Department
                  of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Homeland Security
                  (DHS), and many other federal agencies help create national
                  research and development initiatives that can create and/or
                  transform disciplines.
